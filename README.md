### 🧬 About Me  

I run an independent **Women’s Health Data Lab** that uses **public datasets, reproducible analysis, and plain-language reporting** to make women’s health inequities visible.

My work focuses on how **data, health systems, and structural bias** shape outcomes for women across:
PCOS · endometriosis · pregnancy · postpartum mental health · menopause · metabolic health · and more.

I specialize in:
- turning messy health data into clear insight  
- documenting methods and limitations transparently  
- and translating research so women, advocates, and organizations can actually use it.

This is not medical care — it is **evidence, context, and clarity**.

---

### 🔬 What This Lab Does  

The **Chanaya W — Women’s Health Data Lab** exists to:

- analyze large public health datasets (CDC, NIH, etc.)
- document disparities in women’s health
- publish reproducible notebooks and charts
- and share plain-language research through essays and video

All work is exploratory, transparent, and ethically grounded.
