## About

I am a software engineer focused on building data driven systems, research tooling, and technical infrastructure that support clarity, reproducibility, and ethical data practice.

My work sits at the intersection of engineering, applied research, and research translation. I am particularly interested in how technical systems shape what becomes measurable, interpretable, and actionable in women’s health across the lifespan.

This GitHub documents my engineering projects, research-adjacent tools, and exploratory work. Projects are presented as representative systems with explicit assumptions, constraints, and limitations.

## Focus Areas

- women’s health equity across the lifespan  
- research-adjacent software systems  
- data ingestion, validation, and normalization  
- scheduling, operational, and internal tools  
- transparency, documentation, and reproducibility  

This is not medical care. It is technical infrastructure, analysis, and translation.

## How I Work

- Software engineering with an emphasis on system design and data integrity  
- Clear documentation of tradeoffs and limitations  
- Responsible use of public datasets and external APIs  
- Separation of exploratory work from production claims  
- Preference for clarity over cleverness
